*VDFs based on Class Groups*


**What are Class Groups?**
- focus on class groups of positive definite binary quadratic forms
    - what is that?
    - intuitively: a quadratic curve (parabola) that stays above the x axis is positive definite
    - can represent this quadratic via f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2
    - determinant = b^2 - 4ac (like in quadratic formula)
        - if determinant < 0 => no real solutions => positive definite


how does this help VDFs?
- instead of integer in RSA modulo group, use a positive definite form f(a,b,c) in class group
- order is unknown and hard to calculate
    - no trusted setup required

Squaring algo:
- solve bk = c mod a for k using extended euclidean algo (k has form z + vn)
- then A = a^2, B = b - 2az, C = z^2 - (bz-c)/a
- return f(A,B,C)
